Random Password Generator

A fully responsive web application that generates strong and secure random passwords instantly.  
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout, and practical DOM manipulation.

Project Overview:
The Random Password Generator creates a secure 12-character password that includes a mix of:
l- Uppercase letters (A–Z)
- Lowercase letters (a–z)
- Numbers (0–9)
- Special symbols (@#$%^&...)

It ensures better password strength by combining multiple character types and provides a one-click copy functionality for convenience.

Features:
- Strong 12-character password generation  
-  One-click copy to clipboard  
-  Fully responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)  
-  Clean and minimal user interface.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5 – Structure of the application  
- CSS3 – Styling using Flexbox and Media Queries  
- JavaScript (ES6) – Logic, random generation, DOM manipulation  
- Clipboard API – Copy password functionality  

How It Works:
1. The application defines character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
2. It ensures at least one character from each category is included.
3. Remaining characters are randomly generated.
4. The password is displayed in the input field.
5. Users can copy the password using the clipboard icon.
